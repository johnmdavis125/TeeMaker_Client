Overview

+ TeeMaker is a multi-purpose creative design software built on HTML5 Canvas. While this application is still early on in its development, the main feature ready for demo is the Word Search Builder tool, which can process data from a CSV file and automatically generate Word Search puzzles. This feature, along with additional variations to be built, supports the ‘low-content workbook’ arm of my self-publishing business. 

Project Status: Still in development. Basic MVP for Word Search Generator via Imported CSV is in place and ready for demo. 

Background

+ All of my portfolio projects are tools I use to support my side-hustle business projects oriented around graphic design, self-publishing, & media production. 

+ TeeMaker, once further developed, will support automated creation of multiple types of low-content books for self-publishing, a canvas ‘playground‘ enabling the user to experiment and create custom paint & special effects brushes, as well as a comprehensive suite of image processing effects, all accessed through an adjustable viewport supporting zoom, pan, & animated gestures.
